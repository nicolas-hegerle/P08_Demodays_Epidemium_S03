# Epidemium season 3: ORL/IA
### Predicting the evolution of Papillomavirus-induced ENT cancer from pathology sections of tumor

## Objectives:

Based on pathology (tumor section/slides) data from HPV-induced orophrayngeal cancers we set out to predict the Overall Survival of patients suffering from HPV induced ORl cancer

## Method:

To achieve our goal we first used image data and Deep Learning Convnets or Transfer Learning with Tensorflow Keras Applications Inceptionv3, InceptionResNetv2 and DenseNet201 to try predict overall survival of patients which is the time of survival in months post diagnosis.

## Future implementations:

Incluce clinical data for deep Learning with mixed tabular and image data to try to understand the role of the micro-environmentfor the outcome of cancer patients.
